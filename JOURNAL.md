# July 19th: Started devlog :sob:, trying to route USB traces
I'm sorry I forgot to devlog everything before this :Sob:
I've pretty much finished the schematic and I'm working on the PCB now.
I rotated the RP2040 45 degrees yesterday.
Heres what's new:<img width="1148" height="922" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-19 at 4 34 36 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4e197bf-29ff-4359-a0eb-733fe0048608" />

I'm confused on how to route differential traces and I am not looking forward to those at all.

TOO MANY CAPACITORS to place :sob:
